Here’s a complete **English roadmap** for building a **Sentiment-Based Trading Agent** on the Aptos blockchain for the Thunderdome hackathon:

---

# 🧠 Project Name: **Sentiment Sage – AI-Powered Crypto Trader**

## 🌟 Goal:

Build an AI agent that analyzes crypto-related news/social media for **sentiment trends** and automatically **executes trades** on the Aptos blockchain based on that sentiment.

---

## 🗺️ ROADMAP

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Ideation & Setup (Week 1)**

**Objective:** Finalize concept and prepare environment

* 📌 Define scope:

  * Track sentiment for 1–2 Aptos-related tokens (e.g., APT, USDT on Aptos)
  * Trade based on sentiment spikes or dips

* ⚙️ Tools Setup:

  * Register for Hackathon + join [Telegram](https://t.me/+IPhkTL9iVZo4N2Mx)
  * Set up:

    * Aptos dev environment (Move CLI or Aptos SDK)
    * Python (for scraping + AI model)
    * Google Cloud BigQuery (optional, for onchain data)
    * GitHub repo

---

### 🔍 **Phase 2: Sentiment Engine (Week 2)**

**Objective:** Build a working pipeline that fetches data and analyzes sentiment

* 📰 Data sources:

  * Crypto Twitter (via Twitter API or scraping)
  * News APIs (e.g., CryptoPanic, Cointelegraph RSS)
  * Reddit (optional: /r/aptos)

* 🧠 Sentiment analysis:

  * Use HuggingFace transformer models (e.g., `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`)
  * Classify into: Positive / Neutral / Negative
  * Track sentiment trend over time (rolling average)

* 🧪 Output:

  * "Sentiment Score" for each token every hour
  * Threshold logic: e.g., Buy if sentiment > 0.7, Sell if < 0.3

---

### ⚙️ **Phase 3: Agent Logic + Execution (Week 3)**

**Objective:** Connect sentiment signal to on-chain trading

* 🧠 Agent Workflow:

  1. Pull sentiment data hourly
  2. Decide to buy/sell/hold based on strategy
  3. Interact with Aptos smart contract to trade

* 🔗 Aptos Blockchain:

  * Use **Move** or Aptos SDK to interact with DEX (like Econia or Pontem)
  * Test on Aptos testnet
  * Deploy simple wallet + trading logic agent

* 🧠 Optional Enhancements:

  * Use **Allora** as predictive oracle to feed into strategy
  * Use **Marlin Oyster** for off-chain AI model inference securely

---

### 🎛️ **Phase 4: UI + Testing (Week 4)**

**Objective:** Polish, test, and prepare for submission

* 🧪 Testing:

  * Run sentiment detection + trade simulations
  * Ensure trade logic handles errors (e.g., bad API data, no liquidity)

* 💻 Optional Dashboard:

  * Simple frontend showing:

    * Token sentiment graph
    * Recent trades made by agent
    * Wallet balance

* 📦 Package for Demo:

  * GitHub repo with:

    * Code
    * README
    * Setup guide
  * 2-min video walkthrough (highly recommended)

---

### 🎤 **Demo Day (June 2)**

**Objective:** Present clearly, show impact

* 5 min pitch should cover:

  * What the agent does (sentiment-based trader)
  * How it works (data → sentiment → action → trade)
  * Tools used (e.g., HuggingFace, Aptos, Allora, Google Cloud)
  * Demo of agent in action
  * Impact + future scope
